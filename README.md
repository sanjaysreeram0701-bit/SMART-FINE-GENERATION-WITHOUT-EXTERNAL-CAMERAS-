SMART-FINE-GENERATION-WITHOUT-EXTERNAL-CAMERAS-

This project presents a Smart Overspeed Detection and Intimation System using ESP32, GPS, GSM, and a web interface to enhance road safety and traffic monitoring. The GPS module continuously tracks the vehicleâ€™s speed and location, while the ESP32 compares it with predefined road-specific speed limits. If the vehicle exceeds the limit, a buzzer alerts the driver, and if overspeeding continues, the system calculates a fine and sends an SMS alert via the GSM module to the user. Simultaneously, the ESP32 uses WiFi to update a web dashboard accessible by both users and administrators, providing real-time overspeeding history, fines, and location details. This hybrid approach ensures both offline intimation through SMS and online monitoring via the web, making it useful for personal vehicles, fleet management, and smart city traffic systems.
